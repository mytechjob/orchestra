Then search for your bot on Telegram and start chatting!

## 📖 How It Works

### Conversation Flow

```
User: "Need a birthday gift"
 🤖 Who is this gift for? (e.g., spouse, friend, parent, colleague)

User: "For my spouse"
 🤖 What's your budget range? (e.g., under $50, $50-100, $100-200)

User: "Around $150"
 🤖 What are their hobbies or interests?

User: "They love photography"
 🤖 [Searching and generating recommendations...]

🎁 Here are your personalized gift recommendations:
  1. Professional Camera Lens...
  2. Photography Workshop...
  3. Custom Photo Book...
  ...
```

### Agent Architecture

```
START
  └─► analyze_user_input
        └─► identify_missing_fields
              ├─► (has all info) search_gift_ideas ──► generate_recommendations ──► END
              └─► (missing info) handle_human_input
                    └─► analyze_user_input (loop back with user's answer)
```

### Required Information

The agent collects these fields before making recommendations:

| Field | Example | Why It Matters |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **recipient_relationship** | spouse, friend, parent | Determines gift intimacy level |
| **occasion** | birthday, wedding, holiday | Influences gift type and formality |
| **budget_range** | $50-100, under $200 | Filters by price appropriateness |
| **recipient_interests** | cooking, gaming, fitness | Ensures gift relevance |

**Optional fields** (enhances recommendations):
- `recipient_age_group` - child, teen, adult, senior
- `special_requirements` - eco-friendly, personalized, experience-based

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complete in One Message

```
You: Need a birthday gift for my wife, budget $100, she loves cooking

🤖 [Generates recommendations immediately]
```

### Example 2: Progressive Information Gathering

```
You: Looking for a wedding gift

🤖 Who is this gift for? (e.g., friend, colleague, family member)

You: My colleague

🤖 What's your budget range for the gift?

You: Around $75

🤖 What are their hobbies or interests?

```

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from agent import run_agent_conversation
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage

# Initial query
messages = [HumanMessage(content="Need a birthday gift for my friend")]
state = {}

result = run_agent_conversation(messages, state)

# If agent asks a question
if result.get("current_question"):
    print(result["current_question"])
    # Get user's answer and continue
    messages.append(HumanMessage(content="Budget is $50"))
    result = run_agent_conversation(messages, state)

# When recommendations are ready
if result.get("final_response"):
    print(result["final_response"])
```

### Customizing the Agent

Edit `agent.py` to:
- **Add more required fields** - Update `REQUIRED_FIELDS` list
- **Change question templates** - Modify `FIELD_QUESTIONS` dict
- **Adjust recommendation style** - Edit the prompt in `generate_recommendations()`
- **Change number of recommendations** - Modify `min_length`/`max_length` in schema

## 🎓 Key Concepts

### Human-in-the-Loop

The agent uses LangGraph's `interrupt()` mechanism to pause execution and wait for user input when information is missing. This creates a natural conversation flow:

1. **Analyze** user input for information
2. **Identify** what's missing
3. **Interrupt** and ask a follow-up question
4. **Loop back** with user's answer
5. **Proceed** when all info is collected

### State Management

- **CLI**: State is maintained in memory during the session
- **Telegram**: Per-user state in memory (use Redis/DB for production)
- **State persists** across multiple messages in the same conversation

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallbacks for API errors
- User-friendly error messages
- Conversation can continue after errors

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Agent doesn't ask follow-up questions:**
- Make sure required fields are missing in your first message
- Check that OpenAI and Tavily API keys are set correctly

**Recommendations seem generic:**
- Provide more specific interests/hobbies
- Add special requirements (eco-friendly, personalized, etc.)

**Telegram bot errors:**
- Verify `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- Check that you messaged @BotFather and got the token properly

**Import errors:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check you're in the correct virtual environment
