3. **Budget** - Price range
4. **Interests** - Hobbies and passions

Optional: Age group, special requirements (eco-friendly, personalized, etc.)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Missing environment variables" error:**
- Create `.env` file with your API keys
- See `.env.example` for format

**Agent doesn't ask follow-up questions:**
- Make sure your first message doesn't already include all required info
- Try: "Need a gift" (vague) vs "Gift for wife, $100, cooking" (complete)

**Telegram bot won't start:**
- Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- Verify you got the token from @BotFather

**That's it! Start finding perfect gifts! 🎁**
